                    This project has been created and designed as a university project and is aimed towards people that have little to zero experience in coding/ computer science, and want to go through a simple, fun, engaging, course that will teach the basics of the programming language Python.
                    <br><br>
                    Programming can be a daunting and confusing topic for anyone that has no experience in it. There are lots of videos and explanations online but this can be difficult for someone to choose where and who to learn from as they have no idea where to start and where to look. That is why my project will explain the ideas, purposes, and everything you can hope to learn as a beginner.
                    <br><br>
                    Once you have had a chance to learn, practice, and test your knowledge, then please take the end of lessons test and final questionnaire at the bottom of the Learn webpage.
